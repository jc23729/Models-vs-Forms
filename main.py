# SQLAlchemy provides model: class for logical object
# WTForm provides form class
# A single model may have different forms
# Not all fields on add form might appear on edit form
# Different validation might apply on add/edit
# Different kinds of users (public v admin) have different fields
# Youâ€™ll often take the result of a form and create/edit an SQLAlchemy object.
